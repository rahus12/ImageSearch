# Scalable Face Recognition API with DeepFace, FAISS & FastAPI

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project started as a simple university assignment for face classification but quickly evolved into a **scalable, production-ready face recognition API**.

Instead of training a fixed classification model, this system uses **embeddings + vector search** for flexibility and speed:
- No retraining needed when adding new faces
- Handles large datasets efficiently with **FAISS**
- Provides a clean REST API using **FastAPI**
- Prevents duplicate face entries using similarity thresholds

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Face Search**: Given an image, find the closest match from the database.
- **Add New Face**: Upload a new face with a label. Rejects if similarity â‰¥ 0.95 to avoid duplicates.
- **Scalable**: Designed to handle thousands to millions of faces with low latency.
- **Persistent Storage**: FAISS index, labels, and image paths saved for reuse.
- **API-First Design**: Can integrate easily into any app or service.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **[DeepFace](https://github.com/serengil/deepface)** (Facenet backend) â€“ for generating face embeddings
- **[FAISS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss)** â€“ for efficient similarity search
- **[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)** â€“ for building REST endpoints
- **NumPy** â€“ for metadata storage
- **Python 3.8+**
